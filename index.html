	<p>With jobs growing and more companies coming into the world of business, companies have important information that others seem to want.</p>
        <p>Hackers are breaking into these servers trying to get information they shouldn't be.</p>
	<p>That is why I am studying and interested in the Cyber Security or IT field.</p>
        <p>I want to protect and help organizations as much as possible.</p>
        <p>My goal is to help as many companies as possible strive to become bigger and stronger.</p>
           <p>If you have any questions or problems you may contact one of the developers through the "Contact Me" tab.</p>
