	<h1>Life Story</h1>
       <em><br><h3> Welcome to the Offical website of a young student trying to make a big difference in today's generation.</br>
	   <br> With jobs growing and more companies coming into the world of business, companies have "important" information that others seem to want.</br>
           <br> Hackers are breaking into these servers trying to get information they shouldn't be.</br>
	<br> That is why I am studying and interested in the Cyber Security or IT field.</br>
        <br> I want to protect and help organizations as much as possible.</br>
        <br> My goal is to help as many companies as possible strive to become bigger and stronger.</br>
           <br>If you have any questions or problems you may contact one of the developers through the "contact Me" tab.</br>
