    <h1>About Me</h1>
		<p> Ever Since I was a kid I always wanted to be a Marine Biologist.</p>
		<p> After being diagnosed with Ashtma I knew that being a Marine Biologist Would no longer be as easy.</p>
		<p> I could still have been in the Marine Biologist field but I would not have been able to do what I wanted in that field.</p>
		<p> I always wanted to go under the water and study the sea floor. Studying sharks and other creatures alike was always my dream. </p>
		<p> When we got the news I didn't even know what I wanted to do next. I went from Marine Biology to Video Game Designer then to a Video Game Developer then to Cyber Security.</p>
		<p> Even though my mind was set on Marine Biology for a long time, I felt like Cyber Security was always something I was interested in.</p>
	        <p> I wrestled for Whitehall my freshman year. The following years for high school I did not wrestle because I felt focusing on my academics was more important.</p>
		<p> I attented the Career Tech Center in Muskegon, Michigan in 2016-2018 and earned a couple microsoft certifications in Security and Networking.</p>
		<p> After High School I plan on attending MCC for 2 years and working on CompTAIA Certifications then transferring to Ferris and finishing my degree in Cyber Security or programming.</p>
