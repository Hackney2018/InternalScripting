    <h1>About Me</h1>
		<p> Ever Since I was young I always wanted to be a Marine Biologist.</p>
		<p> After being diagnosed with Ashtma I knew that being a Marine Biologist Would no longer be as easy.</p>
		<p> I could still have been in the Marine Biology field but I would not have been able to do what I wanted in that field.</p>
		<p> Going under water, studying sharks and other creatures alike was always my dream. </p>
	        <p> When we got the news I didn't even know what I wanted to do next.</p> 
	        <p> I made many changes along the way. My first choice was Video Game Development, then I was thinking about Video Game Design.</p>
	        <p> After a while I knew Cyber Security was the field I really wanted to be in.</p>
		<p> Even though my mind was set on Marine Biology for a long time, I felt like Cyber Security was always something I was interested in.</p>
	        <p> I wrestled for Whitehall my freshman year. The following years for high school I did not wrestle because I felt focusing on my academics was more important.</p>
		<p> I attend the Career Tech Center in Muskegon, Michigan in and have earned a couple Microsoft Certifications in Security and Networking.</p>
		<p> When I finish High School I plan on attending MCC for 2 years and working on CompTIA Certifications.</p> 
	        <p> After finishing 2 years of MCC, I will transfer to Ferris State University and finish my degree in Cyber Security.</p>
